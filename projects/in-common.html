            <h3 class="project__title">About the project</h3>
            <p class="project__paragraph">INCOMMON. In praise of community. Shared creativity in arts and politics in Italy (1959-1979) is a research project funded by the European Research Council (ERC Starting Grant 2015) and hosted by IUAV, University of Venice.</p>
            <p class="project__paragraph">INCOMMON is meant to be the first study to systematically analyse the field of performing arts as resulting from the practice of commonality both theorized and experienced over the 1960s and the 1970s. In particular, the project is aimed to study the history of the ‘laboratory Italy’ as the place where artistic counterculture expressed by performing arts arose in a milieu characterized by a profound relation between philosophy, politics, and revolutionary practices.</p>
            <p class="project__paragraph">The overall objectives of INCOMMON are i) to study, collect and contextualize those encounters between theatre, music, visual arts, cinema and video art that assumed the form of performances, especially those created as collaborations between artists; ii) to apply the concept of ‘will-to-the-common’ to the art field of the counterculture; iii) to underline the significance of artistic communities in the local and international scene; iv) to create a digital archive of the performances of the Italian artists of the period.</p>

            <h3 class="project__title">My Role</h3>
            <p class="project__paragraph">I've helped defining the guidelines for the researchers to properly collect and prepare the data in order to visualize them in a meaningful way. I've helped designing the visualizations and their interactions, together with the overall UX/UI of the very first prototype of the digital archive interface. The main task was to give the users the possibily to explore the collection of documents from differents points of view.</p>
